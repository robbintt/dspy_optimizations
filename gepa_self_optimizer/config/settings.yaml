# This file controls parameters for data generation and optimization runs.

data_generation:
  # Number of examples to generate in golden_set.json
  # A small number (e.g., 2-5) is good for quick tests.
  # A larger number (e.g., 25+) is better for robust optimization.

optimization:
  # GEPA optimizer intensity level.
  # Options: "light", "medium", "heavy"
  # Use "light" for fast, cheap test runs.
  # Use "medium" or "heavy" for more thorough optimization.
